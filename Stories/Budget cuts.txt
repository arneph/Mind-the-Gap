Yesterday afternoon President [name 1] and treasury secretary [name 2] held a press conference to announce the budget for the coming fiscal year. The budget contains a number of cuts to federal agencies, which [name 2] defended as necessary given the economic decline, saying that "[phrase 1]"
The most severe cuts are in the department of [noun 1]. Starting on the 1st of January, all employees will be paid [number 1] [noun 2] per month. Retirement savings will be used to fill financial gaps. Instead the employees will receive [noun 3] once they retire. The minimum retirement age has also been raised to [number 2], in order to avoid having to hire new employees for those leaving.
Another area that will be affected by the budget cuts announced by [name 1] and [name 2] is infrastructure. Bridges and damns will only be inspected every [number 3] years. A new policy dictates that roads will only be mended if the holes in them are large enough to fit a [noun 4] in them. And traffic lights will be replaced by [adjective 1] police officers working on a voluntary basis.
Furthermore, the military will experience severe cuts. Instead of machine guns, soldiers are going to use [adjective 2] [noun 5] in order to defend themselves. Tanks will fire [noun 6] instead of the [adjective 3] munition they used before. Battle ships will be controlled remotely by a group of [number 4] year old [noun 7]. The secretary of defence later commented: "[phrase 2]"
The opposition heavily critiqued these plans. "[phrase 3]" said opposition leader [name 3] in the evening, adding that these cuts are only necessary because President [name 1] failed to address economic issues such as the [adjective 4] [noun 8] and the vast number of [noun 9] in the streets. "In his [number 5] years in office [name 1] never took action to aide the [adjective 5] people in this country."
A [adjective 6] debate on the new budget is scheduled for next Wednesday.
