It was one of these nights Inspector [name 1] knew all too well. It was new moon and the streets were pitch black in [name 3]. Ideal conditions to [verb 1] a [noun 1]. There were still [adjective 1] [noun 2] left over when [name 1] arrived with her partner Inspector [name 2]. It must have just happened. "Had we only been [adjective 2]!" thought [name 2]. We might have caught them. But there was nothing the two [adjective 3] Inspectors could do. The [noun 3] were gone with the wind.

Or were they? Suddenly [name 1] heard something behind her. She turned around. Nothing. Just a bunch of [adjective 4] [noun 4]. So they continued to secure the evidence. Then. Quickly. A hush. They could definitely hear someone [verb 2] behind a nearby fence. [name 2] decided to investigate the [adjective 5] noises closer. But as the Inspector approached, a [adjective 6] man quickly ran away. In the darkness there was only his [adjective 7] silhouette. "Damn it! [phrase 1]" thought [name 2].

And so they continued to investigate the scene. They opened a [adjective 8] trash can. Apart from a few [noun 5] and [adjective 9] [noun 6] there was nothing. Frustration grew. Then [name 1] had an idea: "[name 2] look! That [noun 7] over there looks suspicious!" I bet someone is behind it. Both got out their guns and pointed at the [noun 7] in the darkness. And suddenly, out of nothing, a [noun 8] appeared behind the [noun 7]. Both were in panic and fired their guns! They didn't miss. They killed the [noun 8].

Both knew what that meant. "Kill one more [noun 8] and you're out!" had their boss said just yesterday. And so both just stared each other in the eyes. It was one of these stares between [name 1] and [name 2] that said everything - "[phrase 2]". So both decided to keep the incident their little secret. No one needed to know that they shot a [noun 8]. And to this day, no one in [name 3] except two [adjective 10] Inspectors knows what happened in that dark night.
