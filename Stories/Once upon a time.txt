Once upon a time in a far away land - the land of [name 1] there reigned an unhappy king. King [name 2] was concerned about his empire, because all his citizens were constantly [verb 1]. From the moment they got up, till the moment they fell asleep, all day, everyday, everyone was constantly [verb 1]. It became so annoying for King [name 2], that he eventually decided to [verb 2] a [noun 1]. But it didn't help. Everyone was just [verb 1] even [adjective 1].
	
The King then decided to hire a [noun 2]. The King went to great lengths to pay the [noun 2]. He gathered almost his entire fortune. In the end the [noun 2] received [number 1] [noun 3]. But it didn't help. The problem just got worse.
	
In all his despair, King [name 2] advised his aides to go out, and search his entire Kingdom, from North to South, East to West, all [number 2] acres of it, in search for someone with an idea. One of his aides met a fellow named [name 3]. [name 3] was [adjective 2], and told the King to [verb 3] all the citizens. The King was very hopeful. And so they tried. But it didn't work.
	
Out of resources and ideas, the King sat down on his [adjective 3] throne. Then his youngest daughter [name 4], named after a [adjective 4] [noun 4], came in. She saw her father and asked him: "What's wrong daddy?" And so King [name 2] told her about, how all the citizens were [verb 1] all the time. [name 4] thought for a few seconds. Then she said: "[phrase 1]" And then, slowly but surely, the King started smiling. Yes! That was it, that was the solution! He finally knew how to end this madness!
	
The next day, in the middle of his castle, with everyone around, the King proclaimed: "From now on, everyone in this [adjective 5] Kingdom of ours, whenever he or she is [verb 1] again, shall [verb 4] immediately." And from there on, no one in the Kingdom was ever seen [verb 1] again. The King was so thankful for his daughter that he built her a statue the next day. Underneath it said: "[phrase 2]".
	
And so they lived happily ever after.

The End.
